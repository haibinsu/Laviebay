# Laviebay Website
## Introduction
This is a repository for generating our research group website Laviebay. 
## Manual for editing
### Getting Started
You **DO NOT** need to install anything on your computer.

We use the website generator jekyll to establish our website. Use codespaces on github to preview editing results before committing.
### Codespaces Tutorial
Create a new codespace or enter an existing codespace from the header of repository

#### Create local website for preview
In the **Terminal** of the codespace, **RUN**
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --lsi
```
You can also find this command in the [config file](./_config.yml).

(If you create a new codespace, you need to run `install bundle` in the terminal first.)

After the local website is established, you can find the url link at the **PORTS** tab. This local website will response to your edition immediately, refresh for preview.
#### Edit pages
We take HTML and JavaScript as the major languages for our website. You can get basic tutorial [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/).

Directly add HTML and JavaScript codes into the markdown files(.md) in the [pages folder](./_pages/)

#### Save and Commit your edition
If you want to save and commit your work, head to the **Source Control** tab at the left navigation bar. By pressing **Commit** and following the instruction, you can save and commit your results. 

You may then add commit message at the coding area. **Press tick** at the right-up corner to confirm it. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b7249cf-ec04-45f4-85c3-32a876f2fca0)

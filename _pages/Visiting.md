<strong>"</strong>I can certainly say that my time in the Theoretical & Computational Chemistry lab at HKUST was both enjoyable and rewarding! First and foremost, I'd like to express my gratitude to Professor Su for providing me this wonderful opportunity. It was marked by a warm welcome by the very beginning of the program . I was exposed to the cutting-edge computational chemistry and biology research during my six-month internship in Hong Kong. The research led by Prof Su was incredibly fulfilling and beneficial to me. Additionally, along with the careful mentorship of Professor Guo and Abdalla, I was able to work on the project, carry out the computational work flow and eventually create figures and data visualizations based on outputs for publication with the computational and scientific results. We began the genome mining project using computational tools, and then added the deep learning component, which has been really interesting and rewarding. Additionally, physical presence there in the lab during this challenging time due to the prevailing pandemic gave me a deeper understanding of what research entails. I was also exposed to various other projects during my time in Hong Kong, which has contributed extensively to my understanding as a much more holistic researcher. <br>

Coming from a computer science school, I had little familiarity in biology and chemistry. Their patience and kindness, truly moved me. I've also got the opportunity to assist the group members in non-research related matters throughout my period at the lab as well. Now I am confident that one of the best options I intend to pursue after graduation is research. I would have suffered a confusion about research and postgraduate studies if I hadn't had the opportunity to experience it firsthand at HKUST. Nonetheless, thanks to the lab's friendly approach, I was able to travel and visit Hong Kong, then further enjoy my stay, making it a truly unique experience. It was my very first trip to Far East! It's difficult to put into words the entire experience. All of the lab members have been are extremely friendly and helpful, and I felt very much a part of the group during my stay in Hong Kong. In regard to the research experience, I must express my deep appreciations for Prof Su, Prof Guo, and Abdalla's guidance as being highly gratifying and beneficial. Because of their extensive knowledge in the field, I know now that I can turn to them for help in case I have questions about the subject. It's difficult to imagine what the entire experience is like unless you go through it yourself. This group's commitment and discipline in coming up with solutions to a variety of research difficulties was clearly apparent in their care and attention. As a consequence, I hope to be able to continue my research there again and collaborate closely with Prof. Su's research group in the future! <strong>"</strong>

<strong>"</strong>This summer, I had the privilege to be a part of the Theoretical & Computational Chemistry Lab headed by Professor Haibin Su at the Hong Kong University of Science of Technology. I met with Prof. Su 4 months ago, and we have talked about exciting and state-of-the-art techniques in computational chemistry that utilize machine learning, deep learning, novel techniques in NLP, and more. From that first encounter, I concluded that Prof. Su and his lab have a lot to offer both to science and the researchers in the lab. To the science because I concluded that in the lab, they follow and apply the advancements in the field of theoretical and computational chemistry; to researchers in the lab because they are given the opportunity to contribute to the latest advancements in science. That is why I have felt grateful to Prof. Su for offering me the opportunity to join his research team. <br>

As I progress through the research projects that I have been assigned, I realized that my initial thoughts about the lab were accurate; meaning that I had the chance to contribute to and be a part of the latest scientific research. With the collaboration of eager research team members and professors who are experts in their fields, I have worked on three different projects in three months. It was my pleasure to collaborate with all of them and being in part of this helpful community. <br>

Moreover, with the goal-oriented and straightforward research style of Prof. Su, we were able to progress quicker in the research by overcoming the problems we face and finding solutions healthily and fastly. To conclude, I was proud to be a part of this goal-oriented and science-driven lab.<strong>"</strong>

A: Selected examples of reactions from reference papers are presented in Fig. a, which include Lewis structure, compound name, molar concentration, equivalency, temperature, yield and ee values.

B: The proposed workflow to extract reaction information from literatures as illustrated in Fig. b. Original chemical literature (PDF files) will be disposed by PDFrw34 and split into two parts: diagrams and texts. By using the optical structure recognition application tool, the graphs of chemical structures will be converted into SMILES notation texts.

C: The text mined reaction data will be assembled in the template format, and stored into the database as shown in Fig. c.
